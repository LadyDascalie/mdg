# mdg 0.0.2

**Check the releases tab for pre-compiled binaries**

mdg is a no-bullshit tool to turn Markdown into HTML.

Run it and it will render every `.md` file it finds in the current working directory under an `html` folder.

If you have less than 40 files in the folder you are compiling from, `mdg` will generate a menu for your files.

mdg relies on the fantastic [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) for bundling assets and the [github_flavored_markdown](github.com/shurcooL/github_flavored_markdown) markdown parser
